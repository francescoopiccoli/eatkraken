There are two ways to install and test EatKraken: the first is copying the ​ WebContent​ folder into the Apache server root, the other is ​ `cd`-ing to the ​ WebContent​ folder from terminal and running this command to launch the builtin PHP web server:

php -S localhost:8080

While no local postgreSQL database is required as long as the online hosted one is working, to configure EatKraken to use a different, local database, PDO configuration variables in libs/database.php ​ can be quickly adapted. Full compatibility with local MySQL databases probably exist, but table column types need to be adapted beforehand.

Minimum requirements are a local PHP 7.x installation, an Internet connection for database access and optionally Apache or Nginx. Testing under UNIX environments is recommended, but not strictly mandatory.

For testing purposes, external read/write access to the ​ postgreSQL​ database used in the project is possible using the following credentials:

Host:       balarama.db.elephantsql.com
Username:   yhqbrujn
Password:   vTdT4LC9LlOf_rgw6fA-Uz54Q-_xefB5
Database:   yhqbrujn

An alternative “shortcut” can be using the following terminal command in UNIX-like systems:

psql postgres://yhqbrujn:vTdT4LC9LlOf_rgw6fA-Uz54Q-_xefB5@balarama.db.elephantsql.com:5432/yhqbrujn
